# Project Website

Just a website to showcase what I've done and some other content I want to share.
Website is built using Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind, and something else that I've probably forgotten.

Styling is heavily based off of Nier: Automata's UI and metakirby5's rendition of it. Check out his project here: https://github.com/metakirby5/yorha/tree/master

This website is a heavy work in progress, this is a rough roadmap of what's next:
- Change the links in my about me into something more paletable
- Updated style to further build on what I consider the best elements of Nier: Automata's design
- Adding a submenu to certain pages for better navigation
- Adding another section for better content delivery
- Updating the backend to make it easier for me to make posts in the future
